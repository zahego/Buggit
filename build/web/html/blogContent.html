<h3>Homework 1: Homepage</h3>
<p>
    I created the foundation for the website that is the combination between reddit and stackoverflow.
    Very easy peasy since I have taken this class before. No visible problem.
    However, the grading said I had trouble with wrapping, which I'm sure I didn't. Will have to ask again.

<h3>Homework 2: Database</h3>
<p>
    I design and populate the databases.
    No problem except for the possibility that I may miss lab 1. Must do quick.

<h3>Homework 3: JSON Display</h3>
<p>
    In this assignment, I work on the hardcode display of table data through the use of JSON format. Nothing really new was learned, but I got the chance to practice with JSON again.
    Many issues were encounter. 
</p>
<p>First: Does the first requirement ask for both user role and web user table at the same time?
    Turn out the Search-User table require all data from Web-User table plus a few column from USer-Role table</p>
<p>Second: I was trying to do injection with script tag in my js file, but this seems to make the data unrecognization.
    Can't debug as well since console.log within the injection area doesnt work</p>
<p>Third: the combination of sorting and filtering isn't too hard. It takes quite some trials and errors though</p>
