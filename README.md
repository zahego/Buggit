A (almost) social media site that is sipposed to be the combination of Reddit and Stackoverflow. Or at least that's what it is intended to be.
I created this with vanilla JS, HTML and CSS for Web Dev course at Temple University


### Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.  
In case you would like to make this project your own, you need your own MySQL database and got it hooked to the JDBC manager.


### Notable feature
- Single Page Application (main content that is)
- Self created APIs using JSP technologies
- CRUD functionalities, log on/off, filter, etc...
- SQL injection prevention with preparedStatement
- AJAX
- REST
- Vuejs intergration for a dragaable chat box
- Highly customized with css. From title, footer to scroll bar
- Audio autoplay at Page/Demo, even on Chrome, which is extremely difficult since Chrome new policy on audio autoplay
- Many reusable JS components. Many reusable component create the whole HTML interface with functionlaity similar to a React component
- Detailed tutorial with codePen iframe

### Sections
